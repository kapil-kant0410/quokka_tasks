1. Study Project Architecture Essentials
This section covers the foundational elements involved in the construction of software architecture.

1.1. Understanding Project Architecture
Definition of project architecture
Importance of well-structured architecture
How architecture impacts scalability, maintainability, and performance


1.2. Core Elements of Project Architecture

Frontend Layer:
UI Components
Client-side frameworks (React, Angular, Vue)

Backend Layer:
API Development
Business Logic
Frameworks (Django, Spring, Express.js, etc.)

Database Layer:
Relational Databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
NoSQL Databases (MongoDB, Firebase)
ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) usage

Service Layer:
Microservices Architecture
RESTful Services & GraphQL

Security & Authentication:
Authentication (JWT, OAuth)
Authorization (Role-Based Access Control)

Infrastructure & Deployment:
CI/CD Pipelines
Cloud Platforms (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)



2. MVC/MVT and Repository Patterns
explains popular software design patterns used in modern applications.

2.1. MVC (Model-View-Controller) Pattern

2.1.1. Definition & Purpose
Separates concerns in software architecture
Makes code easier to manage and scale

2.1.2. Components of MVC

Model:
Represents data and business logic
Interacts with the database

View:
Handles UI and user interaction
Displays data from the model

Controller:
Acts as an intermediary between Model and View
Processes user input and updates the model/view

2.1.3. MVC in Different Frameworks

Django (uses MVT, a variation of MVC)
ASP.NET (MVC)
Spring  (MVC)
Express.js with templating engines



2.2. MVT (Model-View-Template) Pattern

2.2.1. How MVT Differs from MVC
Used mainly in Django framework
Model (Same as MVC - handles data and business logic)
View (Handles request and response, interacts with Model)
Template (Manages UI presentation, equivalent to View in MVC)


2.3. Repository Pattern

2.3.1. Definition & Purpose
Separates database logic from business logic
Provides a clean way to interact with databases
Improves testability and maintainability

2.3.2. Components of Repository Pattern
Repository (An abstraction layer over data access logic)
Entity/Model (Represents the data structure)
Service Layer (Interacts with the repository to execute business logic)

2.3.3. Advantages of Repository Pattern
Decouples database logic from application logic
Makes unit testing easier
Helps in switching between different databases

2.3.4. Implementation Examples
Django ORM with Repository Pattern
Spring Boot with JPA Repository
Node.js with Sequelize Repository Pattern
